0.3-2
    *	minor changes for compatibility with write-barrier
	and R-devel (no functional difference)


0.3-1	2020-03-10
    *	make sure connections are closed in examples so
	check doesn't complain

    *	add PROTECT() to chunk.apply() and string singletons


0.3-0	2020-03-09
    *	integers incorrectly parsed empty strings to 0
	instead	of NA (#27)

    *	add as.output.raw() which supports both direct file
	descriptors and connections

    *	Extend the handling of as.output()
	as.output() now supports three modes:
	  1) con=NULL: a raw vector is created
	  2) con=connection: writes output to binary connection
	  3) con=iotools.stderr/stdout/fd(fd): writes directly
	     to a file descriptor

	Also as.output() is now pass-through for raw vectors.

	Finally, most methods now support keys to be either a
	logical value to suppress names/row names or it can
	also be a character vector in which case its content
	is used as keys.

    *	add support for logical vectors in fdrbind


0.2-5	2018-01-24

	timeouts were computed incorrectly

	reader

    *	use internal C methods for all output
    	support ragged lists (with recycling) and long vectors in
    	as_output_dataframe

    *	support I() to tag ojebcts that don't want to use
        as.character()

    *	make string coersion rules consistent
	     
    *	re-factor as.output.data.frame to use dybuf

    *	support binary connection con in as.output() instead of
	buffering

    *	add support for quoting via quote= parameter (#25)


0.1-12	2015-07-28
    *	don't import parallel::mc* since it doesn't exist on Windows

    *	remove old stdio API

    *	add quoting to read.csv.raw

	(Thanks to Mike Kane! - #19)

    *	add tests and fixes to make them run on edge cases

    *	fix mstrsplit when given length zero input

    *	re-factor as.output() to use dynamic buffers


0.1-7	2015-02-10
    *	add C implementations of as.output()


0.1-6	2015-02-08
    *	support tab/comma separated files with as.output() when x is a
	data.frame or matrix

    *	make loading hmr silently the default until we rename hmr and
	go to CRAN

    *	fix header=TRUE bug

    *	treat NAs in dstrsplit list input as a way to skip columns


0.1-5	2014-12-15
    *	Removed "pipeline" parameter for chunk.apply and updated the
	documentation

    *	Parallel option added to chunk.apply()

    *	major re-structuring of the raw parsers (dstrsplit and
	mstrsplit)
